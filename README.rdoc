== DESCRIPTION:

Courgette is a Rails engine (plugin) which makes your feature files viewable through
your browser. Install and browse to:

    /features

VoilÃ , pretty list of features. Great for communicating with the customer.

Current version is 0.0.4

== mini ROAD MAP

* not available on production
* browse features & scenarios using treeview
* output features with ruby source for step definitions, so developpers can read a scenario and understand quickly
 what it does without having to open multiple files
* compatible with Rails 3, http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/9/plugin-authors-toward-a-better-future 
* compatible with various versions of rails : http://github.com/ianwhite/garlic
* search feature
* output step definitions source (*_steps.rb) using http://github.com/moro/tsuridana & syntax gem => Is there value?
* add some ruby code browser a la http://github.com/dolzenko/reflexive
* documentation site to show off, mongoid style ;-) http://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-site
