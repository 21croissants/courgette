= courgette

* http://github.com/21croissants/courgette , original idea and code taken from Jonas Nicklas

== DESCRIPTION:

Courgette is a Rails engine (plugin) for Rails 2.x applications which makes your features files viewable through
your browser

http://img.skitch.com/20100922-gj3f5k9cf2qek67yjapcs8nrbr.png

== REQUIREMENTS:

* gem install bundler

== INSTALL:

* script/plugin install git@github.com:21croissants/courgette.git



* Setup Courgette assets by creating a symlink to courgette/public/courgette inside your application's public directory :

$ cd public
$ ln -s ../vendor/plugins/courgette/public/courgette courgette

And browse to:

    /features

VoilÃ , pretty list of features available in all env except "production". Great for communicating with the customer.

== TODO

For the 1st official release:

* clean README
* set up vote for new features to be developped using github issues system)
* comment courgette to http://pivotallabs.com/users/spierson/blog/articles/1363-standup-8-17-2010-rubymine-shortcuts-client-visible-cucumber-results
* send message to cuke mailing list, jo wilk, Matt wynne, tweet it!

== mini ROAD MAP

* fix problem with 'rake features' task broken because bundle exec cant't find envjs :-(
* compatible with various versions of rails : http://github.com/ianwhite/garlic
* output features with ruby source for step definitions, so developpers can read a scenario and understand quickly
 what it does without having to open multiple files
* compatible with Rails 3, check out http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/9/plugin-authors-toward-a-better-future & \
 http://adventuresincoding.com/2010/08/34-ruby-on-rails-3-resources-to-get-you-started/ http://www.themodestrubyist.com/2010/03/01/rails-3-plugins---part-1---the-big-picture
 search feature, using http://rubygems.org/gems/grepper ?
* output step definitions source (*_steps.rb) using http://github.com/moro/tsuridana & syntax gem => Is there value?
or stepdefs cuke formatter (Prints All step definitions with their locations. Same as the usage formatter, except that steps are not printed.)
 
* syntax highligting for i18n features

== Documentation & other projects to take some inspiration

* documentation site to show off, mongoid style ;-) http://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-site
* fork guide : http://help.github.com/forking/
* Use http://github.com/7digital/7features code?

* or a syntax higlighter among http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/11-syntax-highlighters-to-beautify-code-presentation/
http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/index.xhtml seems to be the best?



Merge features from http://github.com/cs3b/cucumber_fe
